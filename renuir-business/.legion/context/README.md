# Renuir — Project Context

Renuir is a lost & found platform that connects people who have lost items
with possible pickups (individuals who may have found them), and allows
hotels, businesses, and institutions to plug in via API when someone
forgets an item at their establishment.

## Who This Is For

- **Losers** — people who lost something and are searching
- **Finders** — individuals who found something and want to return it
- **Business Partners** — hotels, airports, restaurants, transport companies
  integrating via the Renuir API or dashboard

## Key Files

- `goals.md` — current OKRs / objectives
- `priorities.md` — what we're focused on right now
- `projects.md` — active projects & status

- `blockers.md` — what's slowing us down
- `constraints.md` — hard limits (legal, technical, budget)

## QA Baseline
